Topic: Semantic Search and retreival Augemnted Generation(RAG) using Endee Vector Datatbase
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using Endee (high performance vector database) as the central component ,the system supports two very close but distinct capabilities -

   *Semantic Search-retrieving the most relevant document passages using vector similarity
   
   *Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) – generating grounded answers by combining retrieval with a language model
   
The language model is used only after Endee has selected the most relevant information.

Endee
------
Endee is a high-performance open-source vector database designed specifically for semantic similarity search at scale.

Unlike traditional databases that store and query structured data (rows, columns, exact matches), Endee is optimized to store high-dimensional vectors and efficiently retrieve the most semantically similar vectors using approximate nearest-neighbor (ANN) search.

In modern AI systems, Endee serves as the semantic memory layer — enabling applications such as:

*semantic search

*document retrieval

*recommendation systems

*Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

*agentic AI workflows
