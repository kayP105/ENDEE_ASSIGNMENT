Topic: Semantic Search and retreival AUgemnted Generation(RAG) using Endee Vector Datatbase
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using Endee (high performance vector database) as the central component ,the system supports two very close but distinct capabilities -
   *Semantic Search-retrieving the most relevant document passages using vector similarity
   *Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) – generating grounded answers by combining retrieval with a language model
The language model is used only after Endee has selected the most relevant information.
